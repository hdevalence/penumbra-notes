# 2020-05-11: Cryptography design

Creates a new [Primitives](../crypto/primitives.md) section for the cryptographic primitives Penumbra will use.

Adds a rationale for the choice of proof system.

Adds an [overview](../crypto/primitives/decaf377.md) of the `decaf377`
construction with an overview of the relative cost compared to other encodings,
sketches the encoding and decoding functions and adds test vectors.  Specifying
the square root algorithm and hash-to-group map go together.

Also puts in placeholders for a Poseidon instance, and a STROBE-with-Poseidon
construction.
