# 2020-04-16: ABCI domain types

The first design iteration of [`tower-abci`][tower-abci] used raw
protobuf-generated types from the [`tendermint-proto`][tendermint-proto]
crate. However, because these types are generated from protobuf definitions,
they're much less ergonomic: they don't follow Rust naming conventions, they
can't be well-organized into modules, they can't be easily documented, etc.
More importantly, because protobufs require that all fields be optional and
have default values, using raw proto types means that validation checks are
scattered throughout the codebase.

To fix this, [`tendermint-rs` PR #862][pr862] adds a complete model for the
[ABCI] protocol as a set of Rust domain types for each request and response
method, and provides validating conversions between the domain types and the
raw proto types.

Using this code in [`tower-abci`][tower-abci] makes the interface significantly better,
with the bulk of the [`kvstore` example application][kvstore-example] fitting
on one screen of code.
