//! Data modeling for Penumbra transactions.
//!
//! This crate defines data structures that provide modeling of shielded
//! transactions through their entire lifecycle:
//!
//! * the [`TransactionPlan`](plan::TransactionPlan) type completely describes a
//! planned transaction before it is created;
//!
//! * the [`Transaction`] type represents the shielded transaction itself;
//!
//! * the [`TransactionView`] type represents a view from a particular
//! [`TransactionPerspective`] (e.g., the sender or receiver) of the cleartext
//! contents of a shielded transaction after it has been created.
