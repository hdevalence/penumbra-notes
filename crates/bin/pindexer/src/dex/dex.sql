-- This component is responsible for processing events related to the DEX.

-- # Design Choices 
--
-- ## Asset IDs
--
-- We represent them as raw bytes---i.e. BYTEA---, rather than using a 1:1 table.
-- This is probably more efficient, and makes our lives much easier by the fact
-- that given an `penumbra_asset::asset::Id`, we always know exactly how to filter
-- tables, rather than needing to do a join with another table.
