<h2>How to become a Penumbra Summoner:</h2>

<p>To become a Penumbra Summoner, you only need to install Penumbra's command line wallet tool and get testnet tokens.
    Note
    that the testnet tokens have no value.</p>

<p>First, follow the <a href="https://guide.penumbra.zone/main/pcli.html">Penumbra Guide</a>
    to first setup your wallet and receive testnet tokens via the faucet in our Discord.</p>

<p>You're ready to contribute! In the command that follows, you'll be sending some of your testnet tokens to the
    coordinator to bid for a slot to contribute. You need to send a minimum of 1penumbra, but if you want to get to the
    front of the queue, simply bid more.</p>
<p>
    In the Terminal, run:

<pre>cargo run --quiet --release --bin pcli -- ceremony contribute --coordinator-url COORDINATOR_URL --coordinator-address SUMMONER_ADDRESS --phase {{ phase_number }} --bid 1penumbra</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Next, watch the progress bar - this will tell you how long you have left to wait in the queue. Once you are
    selected, your computer will generate your contribution and send it to the coordinator. If you get tired of waiting,
    you can
    increase your bid by running the same command again as above with an additional bid amount - this will get
    <i>added</i> to your existing bid, so you won't lose any tokens.
</p>

<p>Thank you for helping summon Penumbra! ✨✨</p>
