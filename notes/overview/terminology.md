# Terminology

This page contains a list of terminological choices made in these notes.

- We use the terms *delegate* and *undelegate* rather than *stake* and *unstake* to describe bonding funds to a particular validator, to avoid confusion arising from multiple meanings of the word "stake";

- We use the term *holder* rather than *user* to refer to the person or software in control of a given key, to avoid confusion about whether an action is performed by a (human) user directly or by software acting on their behalf;
