//! All structures in this crate have a statically known height, which is used to compute hashes
//! that vary by height.
//!
//! This module contains type-level machinery for computing the height of structures and translating
//! an unary representation good for type-level constraints ([`Succ`] and [`Zero`]) into constant
//! `u64`s suitable for value-level computation.
