# GCS

GCS buckets are encrypted by default, though you can override that with a custom KMS key(s).

Uniform bucket level access is auto-enabled because of [Google's recommendation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access).

## TODO:
* Custom KMS key(s) for encryption
* Lifecycle rules
