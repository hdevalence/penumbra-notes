# Penumbra Testnet Preview Deployment
This directory contains files related to rapid-release
"testnet-preview.penumbra.zone" setup. New deploys
are triggered on every merge into the `main` branch.

Helm vars files provide environment-specific config like FQDNs.
There are no Terraform config files; see `../testnet/` for
cluster config options.
