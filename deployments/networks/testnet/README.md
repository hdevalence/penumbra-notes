# Penumbra Testnet Deployment
This directory contains files related to the weekly penumbra testnet deployment.
It includes Helm vars files and Terraform config logic.
The Terraform config contains some "testnet-preview" logic, as well.
This is because we use a single cluster to host multiple deployments.
