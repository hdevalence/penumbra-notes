{{ $val_name := printf "%s-val-0" (include "penumbra-network.fullname" .) }}
Deployed a Penumbra network, with {{ .Values.network.num_validators }} validators.
The network can be joined *within the cluster* like so:

  pd testnet join http://{{ $val_name }}:26657

Consider joining fullnodes to the network, and exposing the RPC services
for those fullnodes via ingress.
