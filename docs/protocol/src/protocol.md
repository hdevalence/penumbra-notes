- The [Transaction Cryptography][../protocol/transaction_crypto.md] section describes the symmetric keys used at the level of an individual transaction.

## Notation

We use the following notation in this chapter:

* $\mathbb G$ denotes the `decaf377` group;
* $\mathbb F_q$ denotes the BLS12-377 scalar field of order $q$;
* $\mathbb F_r$ denotes the `decaf377` scalar field of order $r$.
