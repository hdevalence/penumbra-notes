# Spend Descriptions

Each spend contains a `SpendBody`, a spend authorization signature, and a zk-SNARK spend proof.

## [SpendBody](#spend-body)

The body of a `Spend` has three parts:

1. A revealed `Nullifier`, which nullifies the note commitment being spent;
2. A balance commitment, which commits to the value balance of the spent note;
3. The randomized verification key, used to verify the spend authorization signature provided on the spend.

## Invariants

The invariants that the Spend upholds are described below.

#### Local Invariants

1. You must have spend authority over the note to spend

2. You can't spend a positioned note twice.

    2.1. Each positioned note has exactly one valid nullifier for it.

    2.2. No two spends on the ledger, even in the same transaction, can have the same nullifier.

3. You can't spend a note that has not been created, unless the amount of that note is 0. Notes with amount 0 are considered dummy spends and are allowed in the protocol.

4. The spend does not reveal the amount, asset type, sender identity, or recipient identity.

    4.1 The spend data included in a transaction preserves this property.

    4.2 The integrity checks as described above are done privately.

    4.3 Spends should not be linkable.

5. The balance contribution of the value of the note being spent is private.

#### Local Justification

1. We verify the auth_sig using the randomized verification key, provided on the spend body, even if the amount of the note is 0. The randomized verification key is derived using additive blinding, ensuring a non-zero key is produced. A note's transmission key binds the authority via the `ivk` and `B_d` in the [Diversified Address Integrity](#diversified-address-integrity) check.

2. The following checks prevent spending a positioned note twice:

    2.1. A note's transmission key binds to the nullifier key in circuit as described in the [Diversified Address Integrity](#diversified-address-integrity) section, and all components of a positioned note, along with this key are hashed to derive the nullifier in circuit as described below in the [Nullifier Integrity](#nullifier-integrity) section.

    2.2. This is in the `ActionHandler` implementation, and an external check about the integrity of each transaction.

3. The circuit verifies for non-zero amounts that there is a valid [Merkle authentication path](#merkle-auth-path-verification) to the note in the global state commitment tree.

4. The privacy of a spend is enforced via:

    4.1 The nullifier appears in public, but the nullifier does not reveal anything about the note commitment it nullifies. The spender demonstrates [knowledge of the pre-image of the hash used for nullifier derivation in zero-knowledge](#nullifier-integrity).

    4.2 [Merkle path verification](#merkle-auth-path-verification), [Note Commitment Integrity](#note-commitment-integrity), [Diversified Address Integrity](#diversified-address-integrity), [Nullifier Integrity](#nullifier-integrity), and [Balance Commitment Integrity](#balance-commitment-integrity) which all involve private data about the note (address, amount, asset type) are done in zero-knowledge.

    4.3 A randomized verification key (provided on each spend) is used to prevent linkability of spends. The spender demonstrates in zero-knowledge that [this randomized verification key was derived from the spend authorization key given a witnessed spend authorization randomizer](#randomized-verification-key-integrity). The spender also demonstrates in zero-knowledge that the [spend authorization key is associated with the address on the note being spent](#diversified-address-integrity).

5. The balance contribution of the value of the note being spent is hidden via the hiding property of the balance commitment scheme. Knowledge of the opening of the [balance commitment is done in zero-knowledge](#balance-commitment-integrity).

#### Global Justification

1.1. This action destroys the value of the note spent, and is reflected in the balance by adding the value to the transaction value balance. Value is not created due to [system level invariant 1](../../transactions/invariants.md), which ensures that transactions contribute a 0 value balance. We do not create value, because of 3.

## Spend zk-SNARK Statements

The spend proof demonstrates the properties enumerated below for the following private witnesses known by the prover:

* Note amount $v$ (interpreted as an $\mathbb F_q$, constrained to fit in 128 bits) and asset `ID` $\isin \mathbb F_q$
* Note blinding factor $rcm \isin \mathbb F_q$ used to blind the note commitment
* Address associated with the note being spent, consisting of diversified basepoint $B_d \isin \mathbb G$,
transmission key $pk_d \isin \mathbb G$, and clue key $\mathsf{ck_d} \isin \mathbb F_q$
* Note commitment $cm \isin \mathbb F_q$
* Blinding factor $\tilde v \isin \mathbb F_r$ used to blind the balance commitment
* Spend authorization randomizer used for generating the randomized spend authorization key $\alpha \isin \mathbb F_r$
* Spend authorization key $ak \isin \mathbb G$
* Nullifier deriving key $nk \isin \mathbb F_q$
* Merkle proof of inclusion for the note commitment, consisting of a position `pos` constrained to fit in 48 bits, and an authentication path consisting of 72 $\mathbb F_q$ elements (3 siblings each per 24 levels)

And the corresponding public inputs:

* Merkle anchor $\isin \mathbb F_q$ of the state commitment tree
* Balance commitment $cv \isin G$ to the value balance
* Nullifier $nf \isin F_q$ of the note to be spent
* Randomized verification key $rk \isin \mathbb G$

### [Note Commitment Integrity](#note-commitment-integrity)

The zk-SNARK certifies that the note commitment $cm$ was derived as:

$cm = hash_6(ds, (rcm, v, ID, B_d, pk_d, ck_d))$.

using the above witnessed values and where `ds` is a constant domain separator:

`ds = from_le_bytes(BLAKE2b-512(b"penumbra.notecommit")) mod q`

### [Balance Commitment Integrity](#balance-commitment-integrity)

The zk-SNARK certifies that the public input balance commitment $cv$ was derived from the witnessed values as:

$cv = [v] G_v + [\widetilde{v}] G_{\widetilde{v}}$

where $G_{\widetilde{v}}$ is a constant generator and $G_v$ is an asset-specific generator point derived in-circuit as described in [Assets and Values](../../assets.md).

### [Nullifier Integrity](#nullifier-integrity)

The zk-SNARK certifies that the revealed nullifier $nf$ was derived as:

$nf = hash_3(ds, (nk, cm, pos))$

using the witnessed values above and where `ds` is a constant domain separator:

`ds = from_le_bytes(BLAKE2b-512(b"penumbra.nullifier")) mod q`

as described in [Nullifiers](../../sct/nullifiers.md).

### [Diversified address Integrity](#diversified-address-integrity)

The zk-SNARK certifies that the diversified transmission key $pk_d$ associated with the note being spent was derived as:

$pk_d â€‹= [ivk] B_d$

where $B_d$ is the witnessed diversified basepoint and $ivk$ is the incoming viewing key computed using a rate-2 Poseidon hash from the witnessed $nk$ and $ak$ as:

`ivk = hash_2(from_le_bytes(b"penumbra.derive.ivk"), nk, decaf377_s(ak)) mod r`

as described in [Viewing Keys](../../addresses_keys/viewing_keys.md).

### [Randomized verification key Integrity](#randomized-verification-key-integrity)

The zk-SNARK certifies that the randomized verification key $rk$ was derived using the witnessed $ak$ and spend auth randomizer $\alpha$ as:

$rk = ak + [\alpha]B_{SpendAuth}$

where $B_{SpendAuth}$ is the conventional `decaf377` basepoint as described in [The Decaf377 Group](../../crypto/decaf377.md).

### [Merkle auth path verification](#merkle-auth-path-verification)

The zk-SNARK certifies that for non-zero values $v \ne 0$, the witnessed Merkle authentication path is a valid Merkle path to the provided public anchor. Only for notes with zero values ($v = 0$) the note is unrooted from the state commitment tree to allow for these "dummy" spends to pass stateless verification. Dummy spends may be added for metadata resistance (e.g. to ensure there are two spends and two outputs in each transaction).

### Diversified Base is not Identity

The zk-SNARK certifies that the diversified basepoint $B_d$ associated with the address on the note is not identity.

### The spend authorization key is not Identity

The zk-SNARK certifies that the spend authorization key $ak$ is not identity.
