# Action Reference

This page is a quick-reference list of transaction actions. Not all actions have proof statements, as only some actions perfom shielded state changes. Actions with proof statements are additionally listed separately for reference.

## All Actions

This table lists all actions, their high-level purpose, and their contributions
to the transaction's value balance. For ease of comprehension, shielded and
transparent contributions to the transaction's value balance are listed
separately, though they are handled by the same mechanism: the chain forms
commitments with a zero blinding factor to accumulate transparent and shielded
contributions together.
