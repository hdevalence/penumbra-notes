This directory is empty except for the firebase config file we use to deploy
rustdoc output, because the contents of the documentation are inline with the
source code.  We use it to stage the rustdoc output for deployment in CI.

The `index.html` can only be generated using nightly Rust, which we want to
avoid in CI, because (1) it interferes with caching and (2) sometimes causes
breakage.  When the list of built crates in the `scripts/rust-docs` script
changes, the `index.html` can be regenerated by setting `REGENERATE_INDEX=1`
like so:

```
REGENERATE_INDEX=1 ./scripts/rust-docs
```

and then commiting the changes, if any, to `docs/rustdoc/index.html`.
