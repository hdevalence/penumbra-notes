# Joining a Testnet

We provide instructions for running both fullnode deployments and validator deployments. A
fullnode will sync with the network but will not have any voting power, and will
not be eligible for staking or funding stream rewards. For more information on
what a fullnode is, see the [Tendermint
documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/nodes/#full-node).

A regular validator will participate in voting and rewards.
