# Using pd

This section describes how to build and run `pd`, the node implementation for
Penumbra:

- [Requirements](./pd/requirements.md) describes the compute resource necessary to run a Penumbra node;
- [Installing `pd`](./pd/install.md) describes how to build `pd`;
- [Joining a network](./pd/join-network.md) describes how to join a remote network;
- [Creating a network](../dev/devnet-quickstart.md) describes how to create a devnet, for instance for local development.

If you're looking for a lightweight solution to interact with the Penumbra network, see the [pclientd](../node/pclientd.md) docs.
