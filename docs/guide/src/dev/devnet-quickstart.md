# Devnet Quickstart

This page describes a quickstart method for running `pd`+`cometbft` to test
changes during development.

To start, you'll need to install a [specific version of CometBFT](../node/pd/install.md#installing-cometbft).

## Generating configs

To generate a clean set of configs, run

```shell
cargo run --release --bin pd -- network generate
```

This will write configs to `~/.penumbra/network_data/`.

## Running `pd`

You'll probably want to set `RUST_LOG`.  Here's one suggestion that's quite verbose:

```shell
# Optional. Expect about 20GB/week of log data for pd with settings below.
export RUST_LOG="info,pd=debug,penumbra=debug,jmt=debug"
```

To run `pd`, run

```shell
cargo run --release --bin pd -- start
```

This will start but won't do anything yet, because CometBFT isn't running.

## Running `cometbft`

To run CometBFT, run

```shell
cometbft --home ~/.penumbra/network_data/node0/cometbft/ start
```

in another terminal window.

## Running `pcli`

To interact with the chain, configure a wallet pointing at the localhost node:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- --home ~/.local/share/pcli-localhost view reset
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- init --grpc-url http://localhost:8080 soft-kms generate
# or, to reuse an existing seed phrase:
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- init --grpc-url http://localhost:8080 soft-kms import-phrase
```

and then pass the `--home` flag to any commands you run to point `pcli` at your local node, e.g.,

```shell
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- --home ~/.local/share/pcli-localhost view balance
```

By default, `pd testnet generate` uses the testnet allocations from the `testnets/` directory in the git repo.
If you have an address included in those files, then use `pcli init soft-kms import-phrase`. Otherwise,
edit the `genesis.json` to add your address.

## Resetting and restarting

After making changes, you may want to reset and restart the devnet:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin pd -- testnet unsafe-reset-all
```

You'll probably also want to reset your wallet state:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin pcli -- --home ~/.local/share/pcli-localhost view reset
```

At this point you're ready to generate new configs, and restart both `pd` and
`cometbft`.  The order they're started in doesn't particularly matter for
correctness, because `cometbft` will retry connecting to the ABCI server until
it succeeds.

## Optional: running smoke-tests

Once you have a working devnet running, you should be able to run the [smoke tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)) successfully. This can be useful if you are looking to contribute to Penumbra, or if you need to check that your setup is correct.

To run the smoke tests:

1. Make sure you have a devnet running (see previous steps)
2. Run integration tests:
```shell
PENUMBRA_NODE_PD_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 PCLI_UNLEASH_DANGER=yes cargo test --package pcli -- --ignored --test-threads 1
```

Find the exact commands for each binary's smoke tests in `deployments/compose/process-compose-smoke-test.yml`.
You can also run the entire smoke test suite end-to-end via `just smoke`, including setup and teardown of the network.
If you want to execute the tests against an already-running devnet, however, use manual invocations like
the `cargo test` example above. You'll need to install [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose/)
to use the automated setup.
